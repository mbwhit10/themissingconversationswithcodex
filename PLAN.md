# Project Backlog — The Missing Conversations MVP

### Immediate Next Steps
- [x] Replace temporary headshot placeholder in `#about-us` with `assets/images/michael-whitaker-headshot.jpg`, add proper alt text, and ensure responsive sizing.
- [x] Update outbound links (Podcast, community buttons) with final URLs or note where copy needs revision.
- [ ] Embed the live ConvertKit form snippet inside `#free-guide` and verify styling matches Tailwind palette.

### Content & Copy Refinement
- [ ] Proofread all section copy against the PRD for tone, clarity, and consistency.
- [ ] Decide on microcopy for form validation/error states and privacy assurances.
- [ ] Add meta tags for social sharing (Open Graph/Twitter) once imagery is finalized.

### Visual Design Polish
- [ ] Build out the old-world aesthetic: add subtle background textures, separators, and map-inspired accents.
- [ ] Finalize color usage and ensure accessible contrast across text/background combinations.
- [ ] Introduce section-specific imagery or iconography that reinforces the “Compass & Map” theme.

### Interaction & Responsiveness
- [ ] Implement smooth-scrolling offsets so the sticky nav does not cover section headings.
- [ ] Audit mobile layout (especially cards and CTAs) and tweak spacing/stacking as needed.
- [ ] Add basic accessibility enhancements (focus states, skip link, aria labels for nav toggle).

### Integrations & Lead Magnet
- [ ] Connect the ConvertKit form action to the appropriate list/tag and test submission flow.
- [ ] Author the automated ConvertKit email that delivers the NotebookLM link.
- [ ] Confirm Netlify form handling fallback if ConvertKit is unavailable.

### Tooling & Deployment
- [ ] Install Node.js locally and switch from CDN Tailwind to a Tailwind CLI/Vite build for optimized bundles.
- [ ] Set up Netlify deploy (build command + publish directory) and connect to the GitHub repo.
- [ ] Add automated checks (Prettier/ESLint or HTML hint) once the toolchain is in place.

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Create a “Resources” or “Latest” section to surface future Substack posts or events.
- [ ] Explore adding testimonials or social proof once available.
- [ ] Plan for multi-page expansion (book, workshops, community hubs) when moving beyond the MVP.

_Keep this backlog updated as tasks are completed or new ideas emerge._
