# The Missing Conversations (MVP)

Single-page marketing site for **The Missing Conversations**, built with semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS utilities.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and open it in VS Code (or your editor of choice).
2. The current prototype loads Tailwind via the CDN so you can open `index.html` directly in a browser and start iterating.
3. Update content in place and tweak styles with Tailwind utility classes. The color palette and fonts are configured inline at the top of `index.html`.

## Local Preview

- Double-click `index.html` to open it, or use a lightweight server such as `python3 -m http.server` if you prefer a local URL.

## Next Steps

- Install Node.js and switch to a proper Tailwind build pipeline (Tailwind CLI or Vite) so production builds are optimized.
- Draft an onboarding email template since the MVP uses manual replies sent from `themissingconversationsguide@gmail.com`.
- Expand the JavaScript in `src/js/main.js` if you need richer interactivity beyond the mobile menu toggle and dynamic footer year.
